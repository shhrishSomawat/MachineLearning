# Predicting Per Capita Income of Canada with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the per capita income (PCI) of Canada using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical data spanning from 1970 to 2016 and is capable of forecasting the PCI for the year 2024.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `canada_per_capita_income.csv`. It contains two columns: `year` and `PCI`, representing the respective year and per capita income in US dollars (USD).

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Model Prediction
After training the model, it predicts the per capita income of Canada for the year 2024. The prediction is approximately 45000 USD.

## Results
According to Google, the per capita income of Canada is estimated to reach around 45513 USD by the end of 2024. The model's prediction of 44602.55 USD aligns closely with this estimate.
